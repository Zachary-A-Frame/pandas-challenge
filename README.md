# Analysis 

In the entire district containing 15 schools, on a budget of ~$24 mil, ~85% passed their reading, and ~75% passed the math portions of their testing. 
The district schools had significantly higher total budgets as well as higher spending per student. With that in mind, charter schools still outperformed them in both categories. Notable differences in this category are also number of students per school. Charter schools had smaller population density. For further analysis in this category, number of students per classroom would be useful. 
Average scores remained fairly consistent per grade, grouped by school, with no exceptions.
